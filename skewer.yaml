title: Skupper Hello World private to private
subtitle: Connect services in isolated on-prem sites
github_actions_url: https://github.com/ssorj/skupper-example-private-to-private/actions/workflows/main.yaml
overview: |
  This example is a basic multi-service HTTP application deployed
  across two Kubernetes clusters, each in its own private data center.

  It contains two services:

  * A backend service that exposes an `/api/hello` endpoint.  It
    returns greetings of the form `Hi, <your-name>.  I am <my-name>
    (<pod-name>)`.

  * A frontend service that sends greetings to the backend and
    fetches new greetings in response.

  The backend service runs in on-prem cluster "private1", and the
  frontend service runs in on-prem cluster "private2".  The privates
  sites are linked by a relay site in the public cloud.  Skupper
  enables the frontend to connect to the backend without a VPN or
  special firewall rules.

  - title: Deploy the frontend and backend services
    preamble: |
      Use `kubectl create deployment` to deploy the frontend service
      in `private1` and the backend service in `private2`.
    commands:
      private1:
        - run: kubectl create deployment frontend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-frontend
      private2:
        - run: kubectl create deployment backend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-backend --replicas 3
  - title: Expose the backend service
    preamble: |
      We now have two namespaces linked to form a Skupper network, but
      no services are exposed on it.  Skupper uses the `skupper
      expose` command to select a service from one namespace for
      exposure on all the linked namespaces.

      Use `skupper expose` to expose the backend service to the
      frontend service.
    commands:
      private2:
        - await: deployment/backend
        - run: skupper expose deployment/backend --port 8080
          output: deployment backend exposed as backend
  - title: Expose the frontend service
    preamble: |
      We have established connectivity between the two namespaces and
      made the backend in `private2` available to the frontend in
      `private1`.  Before we can test the application, we need
      external access to the frontend.

      Use `kubectl expose` with `--type LoadBalancer` to open network
      access to the frontend service.
    commands:
      private1:
        - await: deployment/frontend
        - run: kubectl expose deployment/frontend --port 8080 --type LoadBalancer
          output: service/frontend exposed
